                    Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian. They moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant1. Mario, who has a background as a chef in Italy, relies on family recipes to craft the menu. Adrian, on the other hand, handles the marketing and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian dishes to include a variety of Mediterranean cuisines.
